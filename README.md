## Branching and Merging Instructions.

#### This is our agreed workflow and branching policy.

main = stable (will be final deployment)

develop = main working branch, create feature branches from this and Pull request to develop

Pull requests to be made to develop from features and then from develop to main (squash and merge from develop to main)
